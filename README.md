# alien_invasion

a simple arcade shooter made using pygame.

## Outline

In *Alien Invasion*, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center
 of the screen. The player moves the ship left and right using the arrow keys, 
 and shoots bullets using the spacebar. The objective is to shoot and destroy 
 aliens that appear at the top of the screen, moving across and down the screen
 towards the player. If the player destroys all of the aliens, a new fleet of 
 aliens appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
 the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.
 If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
